mpegdemux
=========

Mpegdemux is an MPEG1/MPEG2 system stream demultiplexer. It can be
used to list the contents of an MPEG system stream and to extract
elementary streams.

Mpegdemux has three primary modes of operation:

- scan. In this mode the MPEG system stream is scanned for elementary
  streams. The first packet of each elementary stream is reported.

- list. In this mode the contents of an MPEG system stream are listed
  in a textual form. This is useful to get an overview of what's in
  an MPEG file

- demux. In this mode elementary streams are extracted from an MPEG
  system stream. The system stream packet structure is dissolved in
  the process. Typically each extracted stream is written to its
  own file.

- remux. This is like demux, except that the MPEG system stream
  structure is left intact. This means that the output is again
  an MPEG system stream with all but the selected elementary
  streams removed.


Examples
========

Get an overview of the elementary streams contained in an MPEG
system stream:

$ mpegdemux -l -k -s all -p all src.mpg


Extract the first video stream:

$ mpegdemux -d -s 0xe0 src.mpg dst.m1v


Extract all audio streams:

$ mpegdemux -d -s 0xc0-0xdf -b audio_##.mpa src.mpg


Remove the second video stream:

$ mpegdemux -r -s all/-0xc1 -p all src.mpg dst.mpg
